The benchmarks.rb file appears under a section named “Changed but not updated” — which means that a file that

is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the git add command

Just keep in mind:

git add is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new

files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved!!!

If you modify a file after you run git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of the file.
