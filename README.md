the content of a web page can be injected in to the page in three stage:
 
* hard coded in the html page.
  this is the simplest but most diffcult to maintain if too many pages.
* store data in file or datatbase, then inject it into pages in
  a compile stage using template.
* inject cotent into pages dynamic at runtime.  
 
**mysite** is a static web site generator works at the second scenario.
