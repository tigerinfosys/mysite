The benchmarks.rb file appears under a section named “Changed but not updated” — which means that a file that

is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the git add command

Just keep in mind:

git add is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new

files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved!!!

If you modify a file after you run git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of the file.

Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your staging 
area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore.
